This is my fork from [StackExchange.Exceptional](https://github.com/NickCraver/StackExchange.Exceptional). I am hoping to do the following with this fork:  
    1. Learn more about .Net MVC mechanism.  
    2. Experiment with github fork/clone/pullreqeust/update upstream feature.  
    3. Hopefull add features that I think are necessary, namely:  
        3.1. Example project that can be opened with VS 2010;  
        3.2. Support for more than one ErrorStores logging at the same time;  
        3.3. Support for email logging;
